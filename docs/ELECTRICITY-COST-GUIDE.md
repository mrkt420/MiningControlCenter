# ELECTRICITY COST OPTIMIZATION GUIDE

## ⚡ UNDERSTANDING ELECTRICITY COSTS

### Time-of-Use (TOU) Rates
Most regions offer variable electricity pricing:

**Peak Hours (4 PM - 8 PM):**
- Highest rates: $0.25-0.40 per kWh
- **Recommendation:** Stop mining during peak hours

**Off-Peak Hours (10 PM - 6 AM):**
- Lowest rates: $0.08-0.15 per kWh
- **Recommendation:** Schedule intensive mining

### Cost Calculation Formula

Daily Cost = (Power_Watts / 1000) × Hours_Per_Day × Rate_Per_kWh Monthly Cost = Daily_Cost × 30 Annual Cost = Daily_Cost × 365


### Optimization Strategies
1. **Smart Scheduling:** Mine during off-peak hours only
2. **Efficiency Tuning:** Optimize power/performance ratio
3. **Renewable Energy:** Solar panels can provide 30-50% savings

**Professional mining operations save 40-60% on electricity costs through smart scheduling.**
