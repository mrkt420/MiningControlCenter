- Analytics interface (analyzes everything, including your snack choices)
- GPU optimization tools (may cause your GPU to request a spa day)
- Benchmarking (compares hash rates, and occasionally astrological signs)
- Automated pool switching (because loyalty is overrated)
- Smart mining scheduler (smarter than your average goldfish)
- Network security & intrusion detection (stops hackers and nosy raccoons)
- Firewall configuration (add your own fire for best results)
- Mining profiles (customize until you forget what the original was)
- Advanced alerts (will ping you if anyone says “blockchain” within a 5 mile radius)
- Automated backups (backs up your files and your hopes and dreams)
- Full documentation (may contain riddles, secret codes, and dad jokes)

Special shoutout to kirk timm for being the mastermind behind the madness. If you find any bugs, just pretend they’re features. Happy mining, and may your hash rates be as legendary as your memes! 🚀😂
